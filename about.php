                <h1>What DormTrooper Does</h1>
                <h5>Dormtrooper is revolutionary new marketplace who's goal is to give students an opportunity to sell their old books for a competetive price, without having to go through the work of setting creating posts of having to schedule appointments with buyers!</h5>
            </div>
            <div class="mt-5">
                <h1>How It Started</h1>
                <h5>It all started with a $3 textbook. My freshman year of college I went to sell back a textbook that I had payed about $30. when I approached the register the cashier scanned my book and said to me in a cheerful voice "Alright, we can give you three dollars for this book!". </h5>
            </div>
            <div class="mt-5">
                <h1>What We Are Doing to solve this problem</h1>
                <h5>I came away from that interaction more suprised than anything that they could offer 10% of original price and still stay in stock, but come to think of it I didnt want to go through the work, of creating posts or negotiating prices, or scheduling meetups to sell my books, I only went there because it was easy. I decided to build DormTrooper around ease of use, and reasonable prices, and i think that you will see as i have that DormTrooper is the best solution of its kind currently in existence</h5>
